-- $intro
-- PostgreSQL-Typed is designed with 2 goals in mind: safety and performance. The
-- primary focus is on safety.
--
-- To help ensure safety, it uses the PostgreSQL server to parse every query
-- and statement in your code to infer types at compile-time. This means that
-- in theory you cannot get a syntax error at runtime. Getting proper types at
-- compile time has the nice side-effect that it eliminates run-time type
-- casting and usually results in less code. This approach was inspired by
-- MetaHDBC (<http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/MetaHDBC>) and PG'OCaml
-- (<http://pgocaml.berlios.de/>).
--
-- While compile-time query analysis eliminates many errors, it doesn't
-- eliminate all of them. If you modify the database without recompilation or
-- have an error in a trigger or function, for example, you can still trigger a
-- 'PGError' or other failure (if types change).  Also, nullable result fields resulting from outer joins are not
-- detected and need to be handled explicitly.
--
-- Based originally on Chris Forno's TemplatePG library.
-- A compatibility interface for that library is provided by "Database.PostgreSQL.Typed.TemplatePG" which can basically function as a drop-in replacement (and also provides an alternative interface with some additional features).

-- $usage
-- Basic usage consists of calling 'pgConnect', 'pgSQL' (Template Haskell quasi-quotation), 'pgQuery', and 'pgDisconnect':
-- You must enable TemplateHaskell and/or QuasiQuotes language extensions.
--
-- > c <- pgConnect
-- > let name = "Joe"
-- > people :: [Int32] <- pgQuery c [pgSQL|SELECT id FROM people WHERE name = ${name}|]
-- > pgDisconnect c

-- $connect
-- All database access requires a 'PGConnection' that is created at runtime using 'pgConnect', and should be explicitly be closed with 'pgDisconnect' when finished.
-- 
-- However, at compile time, PostgreSQL-Typed needs to make its own connection to the database in order to describe queries.
-- By default, it will use the following environment variables:
-- 
-- [@TPG_DB@] the database name to use (default: same as user)
-- 
-- [@TPG_USER@] the username to connect as (default: @$USER@ or @postgres@)
-- 
-- [@TPG_PASS@] the password to use (default: /empty/)
-- 
-- [@TPG_HOST@] the host to connect to (default: @localhost@)
-- 
-- [@TPG_PORT@ or @TPG_SOCK@] the port number or local socket path to connect on (default: @5432@)
-- 
-- If you'd like to specify what connection to use directly, use 'useTPGDatabase' at the top level:
--
-- > useTPGDatabase PGDatabase{ ... }
--
-- Note that due to TH limitations, the database must be in-line or in a different module.  This call must be processed by the compiler before (above) any other TH calls.
--
-- You can set @TPG_DEBUG@ at compile or runtime to get a protocol-level trace.

-- $query
-- There are two steps to running a query: a Template Haskell quasiquoter to perform type-inference at compile time and create a 'PGQuery'; and a run-time function to execute the query ('pgRunQuery', 'pgQuery', 'pgExecute').

-- $compile
-- Both TH functions take a single SQL string, which may contain in-line placeholders of the form @${expr}@ (where @expr@ is any valid Haskell expression that does not contain @{}@) and/or PostgreSQL placeholders of the form @$1@, @$2@, etc.
--
-- > let q = [pgSQL|SELECT id, name, address FROM people WHERE name LIKE ${query++"%"} OR email LIKE $1|] :: PGSimpleQuery [(Int32, String, Maybe String)]
--
-- Expression placeholders are substituted with PostgreSQL ones in left-to-right order starting with 1, so must be in places that PostgreSQL allows them (e.g., not identifiers, table names, column names, operators, etc.)
-- However, this does mean that you can repeat expressions using the corresponding PostgreSQL placeholder as above.
-- If there are extra PostgreSQL parameters the may be passed as arguments:
--
-- > [pgSQL|SELECT id FROM people WHERE name = $1|] :: String -> PGSimpleQuery [Int32]
--
-- To produce 'PGPreparedQuery' objects instead, put a single @$@ at the beginning of the query.
-- You can also create queries at run-time using 'rawPGSimpleQuery' or 'rawPGPreparedQuery'.

-- $run
-- There are multiple ways to run a 'PGQuery' once it's created ('pgQuery', 'pgExecute'), and you can also write your own, but they all reduce to 'pgRunQuery'.
-- These all take a 'PGConnection' and a 'PGQuery', and return results.
-- How they work depends on the type of query.
--
-- 'PGSimpleQuery' simply substitutes the placeholder values literally into into the SQL statement.  This should be safe for all currently-supported types.
-- 
-- 'PGPreparedQuery' is a bit more complex: the first time any given prepared query is run on a given connection, the query is prepared.  Every subsequent time, the previously-prepared query is re-used and the new placeholder values are bound to it.
-- Queries are identified by the text of the SQL statement with PostgreSQL placeholders in-place, so the exact parameter values do not matter (but the exact SQL statement, whitespace, etc. does).
-- (Prepared queries are released automatically at 'pgDisconnect', but may be closed early using 'Database.PostgreSQL.Typed.Protocol.pgCloseQuery'.)

-- $templatepg
-- There is also an older, simpler interface based on TemplatePG that combines both the compile and runtime steps.
-- 'Database.PostgreSQL.Typed.TemplatePG.queryTuples' does all the work ('Database.PostgreSQL.Typed.TemplatePG.queryTuple' and 'Database.PostgreSQL.Typed.TemplatePG.execute' are convenience
-- functions).
--
-- It's a Template Haskell function, so you need to splice it into your program
-- with @$()@. It requires a 'PGConnection' to a PostgreSQL server, but can't be
-- given one at compile-time, so you need to pass it after the splice:
--
-- > h <- pgConnect ...
-- > tuples <- $(queryTuples "SELECT * FROM pg_database") h
--
-- To pass parameters to a query, include them in the string with {}. Most
-- Haskell expressions should work. For example:
--
-- > let owner = 33 :: Int32
-- > tuples <- $(queryTuples "SELECT * FROM pg_database WHERE datdba = {owner} LIMIT {2 * 3 :: Int64}") h
-- 
-- TemplatePG provides 'Database.PostgreSQL.Typed.TemplatePG.withTransaction', 'Database.PostgreSQL.Typed.TemplatePG.rollback', and 'Database.PostgreSQL.Typed.TemplatePG.insertIgnore', but they've
-- not been thoroughly tested, so use them at your own risk.

-- $types
-- Most builtin types are already supported.
-- For the most part, exactly equivalent types are all supported (e.g., 'Int32' for int4) as well as other safe equivalents, but you cannot, for example, pass an 'Integer' as a @smallint@.
-- To achieve this flexibility, the exact types of all parameters and results must be fully known (e.g., numeric literals will not work).
-- Currently only 1-dimensional arrays are supported.
--
-- However you can add support for your own types or add flexibility to existing types by creating new instances of 'Database.PostgreSQL.Typed.Types.PGParameter' (for encoding) and 'Database.PostgreSQL.Typed.Types.PGColumn' (for decoding).
-- If you also want to support arrays of a new type, you should also provide a 'Database.PostgreSQL.Typed.Types.PGArrayType' instance (or 'Database.PostgreSQL.Typed.Types.PGRangeType' for new ranges):
-- 
-- > instance PGParameter "mytype" MyType where
-- >   pgEncode _ (v :: MyType) = ... :: ByteString
-- > instance PGColumn "mytype" MyType where
-- >   pgDecode _ (s :: ByteString) = ... :: MyType
-- > instance PGArrayType "mytype[]" "mytype"
--
-- Required language extensions: FlexibleInstances, MultiParamTypeClasses, DataKinds

-- $nulls
-- Sometimes PostgreSQL cannot automatically determine whether or not a result field can
-- potentially be @NULL@. In those cases it will assume that it can. Basically,
-- any time a result field is not immediately traceable to an originating table
-- and column (such as when a function is applied to a result column), it's
-- assumed to be nullable and will be returned as a 'Maybe' value.  Other values may be decoded without the 'Maybe' wrapper.
--
-- You can use @NULL@ values in parameters as well by using 'Maybe'.

-- $caveats
-- The types of all parameters and results must be fully known.  This may
-- require explicit casts in some cases (especially with numeric literals).
--
-- You cannot construct queries at run-time, since they
-- wouldn't be available to be analyzed at compile time (but you can construct them at compile time by writing your own TH functions).
--
-- Because of how PostgreSQL handles placeholders, they cannot be used in place of lists (such as @IN (?)@). You must replace such cases with equivalent arrays (@= ANY (?)@).
--
-- For the most part, any code must be compiled and run against databases that are at least structurally identical.
-- However, some features have even stronger requirements:
--
--   * The @$(type, ...)@ feature stores OIDs for user types, so the resulting code can only be run the exact same database or one restored from a dump with OIDs (@pg_dump -o@).  If this is a concern, only use built-in types in this construct.

-- $tips
-- If you find yourself pattern matching on result tuples just to pass them on
-- to functions, you can use @uncurryN@ from the tuple package. The following
-- examples are equivalent.
--
-- > (a, b, c) <- $(queryTuple "SELECT a, b, c FROM table LIMIT 1")
-- > someFunction a b c
-- > uncurryN someFunction \`liftM\` $(queryTuple "SELECT a, b, c FROM table LIMIT 1")
