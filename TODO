* Bail when standard_conforming_string is off (can be seen in connection details returned from server).
* Handle bounds for integers better (automatically allow anything smaller through, but block bigger values).
* Add support for returning records (instead of tuples).
* Make insertIgnore useable in transactions.
* On disconnect, send a close message?
* Figure out how to make withTransaction useable in other monads.
* Add support for enumerated types (look in pg_enum with unknown types).
